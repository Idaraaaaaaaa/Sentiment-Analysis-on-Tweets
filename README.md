# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Tweets
Problem statement

Analyzing sentiment in social media, particularly Twitter, presents a complex challenge due to the diverse nature of user-generated content and the nuances of language. Traditional methods often struggle with the variability and noise inherent in Twitter data, which includes slang, sarcasm, and varying sentence structures. These factors can complicate sentiment classification, affecting the accuracy of predictive models.

This project aims to develop an advanced sentiment analysis model using Twitter data, focusing on classifying tweets as positive or negative based on their content. We aim to employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for robust text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopwords removal, and lemmatization. The model will utilize Logistic Regression, a well-established classification algorithm, to accurately predict sentiment labels. The insights gained from this analysis will provide a valuable understanding of public sentiment trends on Twitter, facilitating applications in market research, brand management, and social listening.
